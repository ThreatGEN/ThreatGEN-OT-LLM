# ThreatGEN OT LLM Project

Welcome to the ThreatGEN OT LLM Project. Our goal is to create quality and accurate LLMs that are specifically trained for OT cybersedurity use cases, open-source and free to use. 

## What is the ThreatGEN OT LLM Project?

The ThreatGEN OT LLM Project is an open-source project with the goal of creating a quality and accurate LLM specically tasked with OT cybersecurity knowledge. Our goal is to inspire community support to help create datasets, fine tuned models, and community support/discussions, to leverage the power of LLMs to make OT cybersecurity more efficient, more accurate, and democratized.  

## Models

The OT LLMs will be fine tuned using the following foundational models:

* LLama 2 (and 3 when it becomes available)
* Mistral
* White Rabbit Neo (this model is fine tuned specifically for cybersecurity use cases)
* Other viable models as the technology and models evolve

All fine tuned models will be available here and in Hugging Face. This is a new project so models will begin comming available in the comming days/weeks follwing S4x24.

## How to Get Involved

If you would like to get involved in this project, we are looking for the following contributions:

* Raw data for creating data sets
* Fine tuning dataset creation (question and answer sets)
* Model fine tuning
* Testing and feedback

## What We Will Provide

* Access to this repository, which includes all fine tuned models, instructions, and scripts
* Access to all fine tuned models on Hugging Face
* Discord channel for real-time collaboration
* Live training sessions
* Community collaboration meetings/streams
