# Models

The models are currently being fine tuned and are not yet available. As soon as they become available (we estimate the week after S4x24), they will be posted here as well as in the Hugging Face models repository for easy access from platforms such as LM Studio. All fine-tuned models we create are open-source and freely available to use for commercial and non-commercial use.
